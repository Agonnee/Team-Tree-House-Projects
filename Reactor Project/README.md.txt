# Reactor Project:
## Project to demonstrate the differences between different types of power Generation.

As someone with knowledge of reactor plant operations, my goal is to eventually build an app that will allow users to learn about differences between nuclear power and other power generation methods and hopefully learn about nuclear power. 

Hopefully the education will cause people to be less afraid of nuclear power. I aim to be non-biased in the information displayed in this project in order to accurately represent differences.

All models created will be based on research found and listed in Resources.txt

I expect a lot of restructuring and learning in my coding ability through this project. For anyone who either reads this early, or looks back this far in the future:
Thank you for your support.



##This file is to test the operations of Github and provide some proficiency.
(Remarks all moved from Reactor.py to here)

##I heard a horror story of a new dev committing over all of a senior dev's changes
##I want to make sure that is not a mistake I make.

This comment should show up on the online file

I am going to try to branch and then pull on this project change this value to 100 when you get this on desktop: 100

Not quite sure how it works yet but still testing these comments will be left in for educational tracking.

This comment is left in the first branch I've made from the github desktop.
Branches are for the entire repository, not just an individual folder within
Time to learn pull requests and pushing to the branch.

Now that I've managed to set up my ssh key and learned how to push to github from a CLI

It is time to see if I can pull this repo through GitBash, update this file, and push it back.

Successfully changed directories and pulled this repo, now to see if I can commit and push

# This is my first repository, I am learning Git through working on this

This is the README for the repository, I'll be adding information here as needed.


Currently, I have not done anything to make this useful. I hope to change that soon.
I'll be making folders for my individual projects within this repository.

Reactor Project is my testing of Github interfaces and operations. Leaving a trail of comments for myself to understand changes made and get a feel for branch/pull/commit/push.
